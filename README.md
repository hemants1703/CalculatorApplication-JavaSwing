# Project Setup üëæ
In order to setup this project on your local system you need the following tools
- JDK 17
- Apache NetBeans (I used version 17)

First open the cloned project in Apache NetBeans and navigate to the ```src/main/java/com/mycompany/calculator``` and find the ```CalculatorUI.java``` file which is the whole code of the Calculator Application.

# Build the Application
In the ```pom.xml``` file there are certain Maven dependencies using which this app is build as a JAR file so in order to build this application,
- Right click on the project in the NetBeans files viewer tab on the left-most side and choose ***Clean*** first. This cleans the entire project and all the build files.
- Again right-click the project name in the files viewer and click ***Build with Dependencies***
- Now you can see a new directory/folder will be created with the name **_target_** 
- The file named ```Calculator-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar``` is the file that is your Application
